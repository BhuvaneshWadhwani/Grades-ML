# Prediction Modeling for Student Math Grades

## Project Overview
This university project employs machine learning/prediction modeling techniques to forecast students' mathematics grades based on socio-economic factors. The analysis is conducted using RMarkdown, with both the source code and an HTML output file provided for easy viewing.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset available on Kaggle: [Student Performance in Mathematics and Portuguese](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrigaankjaswal/student-performance-in-mathematics-and-portuguese)

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Data Exploration
- Data description and cleaning
- Assessment of normality, variance, and collinearity
- Final variable selection

### Part 2: Modeling
Implementation of various predictive models:
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Regularized Regression (Elastic Net)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Boosting

### Part 3: Model Comparison
- Fold-wise comparison
- Model-wise comparison
- Identification of top 3 important variables

### Part 4: Model Performance Analysis
- Comparison of highest-performing model in training vs. test sets
- Bootstrapping analysis
- Examination of changes in variable importance
- Visual inspection of interaction effects using PDP plots
- Assessment of additive and interaction effects
- Creation of Partial-Dependence and Ceteris-Paribus Profiles

### Part 5: Model Prediction Test
- Introduction of an artificial participant with randomized social factor values to test model predictions

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the RMarkdown file in your preferred R environment
3. Run the code chunks sequentially
4. Alternatively, view the HTML file for a quick overview of the results
