# Grades-ML
This is a prediction modeling university project aimed at using machine learning to predict students' math grades through socio-economic factors. The project was done in RMarkDown. Although I have already moved on to other projects, please feel free to leave some feedback :) <br />
The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrigaankjaswal/student-performance-in-mathematics-and-portuguese.

# Part 1: Data exploration
  Data description and cleaning <br />
  Check for violations in normality, variance, collinearity <br />
  Finalize variables to be used <br />

# Part 2: Modeling
  Multiple Linear Regression <br />
  Regularized Regression (Elastic Net) <br />
  Decision Tree <br />
  Random Forest <br />
  Boosting <br />

# Part 3: Comparing Models
  By Fold <br />
  By Model <br />
  Check variable importance (Top 3 variables) <br />

# Part 4: Model Performance
  Check highest performing model in train vs test set <br />
  Bootstrapping <br />
  Changes in variable importance <br />
  PDP plots to check for interaction effects visually <br />
  Check for additive and interaction effects <br />
  Create Partial-Dependence and Ceteris-Paribus Profiles <br />

# Part 5: Model Prediction Test
  Added an artificial participant (random social factor values) to see what grade the model will predict
